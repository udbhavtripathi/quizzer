Welcome to the Course GPT repository. This web application is designed to generate personalized course content based on user preferences, utilizing the power of ChatOpenAI model and Langchain.


## Introduction
Course GPT empowers users to effortlessly create tailored mini-courses that match their specific interests and learning goals. By leveraging the capabilities of ChatOpenAI model and Langchain, this app streamlines the process of generating course content.


## How It Works
Users input their desired course topic, number of days, application area, and course level.
The app utilizes ChatOpenAI model and Langchain to dynamically generate module and subtopic suggestions.
